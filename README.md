# What is problem-set-solver?
PSS is a minimal module loader made in python, and is intended to make doing repetitive homework easier.
It is a fast, open-source, community-run project that anyone can use freely.

# How do I install it?
## 1. Install python
To download python, go to https://www.python.org/, and download a python version above version 3.10
To install python, open the installed file and run through the installer to install python.

To check if you already have python, you can open a shell (step 2) and type `python --version`
 - If you see `Python 3.XX.X`, then you have installed it successfully
 - If you see an error message, then you do not have it installed on your system.
## 2. Open a shell 
Any shell will do for this step, so here are some of the most common ones:
 - On Windows, press the windows key (âŠž) and type `cmd`, then press enter. A window named `Command Prompt` should open.
 - On Linux, **you know what to do.**
 - On Mac, click the Launchpad icon in the Dock, type Terminal in the search field, then click Terminal.
 - On ChromeOS, there is no builtin hell if it is a managed device, but you can use ones like the picoCTF webshell to do your bidding. To access the webshell, you need an account on https://picoctf.org/
## 3. Run `git clone https://github.com/ArrowSlashArrow/problem-set-solver-v2`
 - Once downloaded, `cd problem-set-solver-v2` to move into the probelm set solver directory
## 4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - This will install all the requirements, and this is necessary because the program will not run without them
## 5. Run `python main.py`
 - This will run the program
